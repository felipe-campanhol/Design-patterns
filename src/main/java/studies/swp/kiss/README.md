### KISS - This principle help the developer to create and maintain the code as simple as possible

- K — Keep
- I — It
- S — Simple
- S — Stupid

The **violation** is when a code repeat itself and taking hundreds or even thousands lines, causing headaches to whoever needs to maintain the system

Some of the **good practices** that KISS principle brings are:

* Each method should have maximum of 50 lines
* Keep the code as clean as possible
* Programming languages are made for humans understand, so put in practice native methods that can be avoid the duplicity
