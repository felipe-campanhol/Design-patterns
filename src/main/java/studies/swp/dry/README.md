### DRY - This principle aim to avoid repetition on the code

- D — Don't
- R — Repeat
- Y — Yourself

A **bad practice** is called WET, which stands for: waste everyone's time or we enjoy typing, would be a code which have many repetition of methods, conditions and loops, making the code hard to track and maintain

In the contrary, **the benefits** of applying this principle in your code are:

* Less code is good - any well written code generally are short, makes easier to read and to modify if needed
* Division of code - another good practice is to divide methods and classes, this can be achieved by looking at others principles like solid and kiss
* Reuse the code - alongside of division, the reuse will be achieved when splitting the code by methods and classes
